I'm a computer scientist, researcher, and currently a PhD student at the <a href='https://cispa.de/en'>CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security</a> (and <a href='https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html'>Saarland University</a>) with <a href='https://cispa.de/en/people/katharina.krombholz'>Dr. Katharina Krombholz</a> as my supervisor. Before that, I was at <a href='https://lums.edu.pk/'>LUMS, Pakistan</a> for my Bachelors degree in Computer Science. 

My research focuses on Usable Security and Privacy, where I use data science, human-computer interaction, and social science methods to understand and solve the challenges users face. I am particularly interested in finding ways to help marginalized and at-risk communities with their digital safety, privacy, and security.

Apart from work, I love cooking, swimming, learning about history, and I vibe to just about anything that seems fun.
